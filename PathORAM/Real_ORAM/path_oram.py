class PathORAM:
    """
    PathORAM implements the Path Oblivious RAM protocol with support for both direct data accesses
    and recursive position map accesses. The ORAM tree is stored in a remote memory abstraction,
    organized as a binary tree of buckets, while the position map is maintained either locally
    (using LocalPosPathORAM) or recursively (by instantiating another PathORAM) based on available local memory.

    The design uses a power-of-two rounded number of blocks (N) to create a complete binary tree.
    When the total number of blocks is small enough (i.e. less than the specified local_memory_capacity),
    the position map and tree are stored in local memory for efficiency. Otherwise, a recursive mechanism
    is employed.

    Parameters:
      N (int): The number of blocks in the clientâ€™s working set. This value is rounded up to a power of two.
      b (int): The size (in bits) of each server block.
      Z (int): The capacity (number of blocks) per bucket in the ORAM tree.
      element_size (int): The size (in bits) of each data element.
      local_memory_capacity (int): The threshold (in server blocks) that determines whether to store the
                                   position map and tree locally. If N is smaller than this capacity,
                                   a local position map is used.
      upper_level_N (int): The number of elements for the upper-level position map (if any). Defaults to 0.
